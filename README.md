# DevAssist Browser Extension

DevAssist is an open-source browser extension. When interacting with any smart contract using Metamask wallet, the DevAssist Extension is activated and provides an explanation in plain English of the smart contract's code. This explanation is generated by ChatGPT after thoroughly analyzing the code. This means that users no longer need to be Solidity developers to understand what they are about to confirm and risk their crypto assets.
